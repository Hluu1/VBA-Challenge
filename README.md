# VBA-Challenge
In this file, there a three screenshots of my results based on using the code written in VBA.
The code is also found in this file named, "StockAnalysis.bas".
In each screenshot, the formula has created four new columns in the spreadsheet, called Ticker, Yearly Change, Percent change and Total Volumn, while also showing data that it has calculated based on all the data that was already present. 
There is also another section that it creates which also displays which ticker, has the greatest percentage increase, Greatest percentage decrease and greatest voluumn change along with, the relevant values for said categories.
I have also used Conditional formatting with the formula, "if Cell Value <= -0.01 fill cell with the colour Red" and, "If Cell Value >= 0 then fill cell with the colour Green". These formulas are used in the column "Yearly Change" to colour the Positve increases or negative decreaces for a ticker.
